#Summary

For our second project we used Jquery to access API's and extract information and display it. With CSS animations to smoothly show it and give feed back for the user. Also learned what GULP and NPM do to use open source tools to help ourselves while coding to make lives easier.

#What did I learn?

I learned more Javascript mainly connected to Ajax, Json and Api's. Ajax being a way to request information allowing us to work with other websites to connect to them in customizable way. Json is a type of information that we can easily work with and with very little help from Jquery to turn it into a Javascript accessible file. And Apis are this interesting way of having other sites send us select information they are willing to let us work with. I learned how to travel not only through the DOM but also through a Json file which are very similar but also nothing alike.
